# Data protection and privacy
- Read and understand the content of the paper
- Implement the algorithm as a tool (in any language you want)
- Find online a dataset to use for tests/analysis (indicate the source of the dataset), students of 9 credits can decide to generate a fake dataset (of a context of your choice)
- Test and validate the correctness of the algorithm on the chosen dataset
- Perform an analysis of the tool on the generated data on:
  - efficiency and complexity
  - privacy-utility level
  - statistical information before/after
